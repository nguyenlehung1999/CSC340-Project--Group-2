## 📘 Project Description
The **Lost and Found Pet Local App** is a community-driven web platform designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners. It enables users to publish, search, and respond to pet reports in real-time using the latest information such as last seen location and time. The platform strengthens collaboration between pet owners, finders, and system administrators for improved community outcomes.
