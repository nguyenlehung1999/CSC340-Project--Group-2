## Description 
> The Lost and Found Pet Local app is a community-driven platform designed to help pet owners reunite with their lost pets and enable community members to report found pets. The app connects pet owners and finders in real-time and make it easier to find lost pets based on providing updates on information about last seen location and last seen time of the pets.

## App Functions
1. Customer (Lost pet owner):
    1. Create/modify customer profile - Register as a lost pet owner.
    2. View available services - .Publish pictures of your pet, descriptions, and the last known locations of your pet. They will also have the ability to look through lost pet reports and see if their pet has been found.
    3. Subscribe to available services - .Post your lost pet and wait for members to interact with your post or update you on your pet's whereabouts
       4. Write reviews for subscribed services - The owners will be able to give reviews to someone who helped them or found their pet, letting other owners see how helpful a community member was.


       HOW TO RUN THE CODE: You can use the ampps database to manually create a user or you can use the sign up page and that should add a user to the database. After that, you should be able to use the rest of the use-cases.
